# TIFFany
TIFFany is a Python package which aims to identify and compare differences between input images. It performs this via various image processing tasks, such as calculating the mean-square error (MSE) and structural similarity indexing (SSIM). Visual operations, such as the Gaussan blur, median blur, etc, are also available to be implemented through the package.
