# TIFFany
TIFFany is a Python package which aims to perform various different computer vision tasks, with a primary focus on the identification and comparison of differences between the images. Differences are calculated through implementations of common image processing tasks, such as the mean-square error (MSE) and the structural similarity index (SSIM). Visual operations such as the Gaussian blur, median blur, absolute difference, etc are also available as operations, amongst various others.
